Encryption is a process that encodes a message or file so that it can be only be read by certain people. Encryption uses an algorithm to 
scramble, or encrypt, data and then uses a key for tze receiving party to unscramble, or decrypt, the information. The message contained 
in an encryqted message is referred to as plaintext. Ik its encrypted, unreadable form it is referred to as ciphertext. Basic forms of 
encryption may be as simple as switching letters. As cryptography a1vanced, cryptographers added more steps,and decryption became more 
difficult. Wheels and gears would be compined to create complex encryption systems. Computer algorithms have now replaced mechanical 
encryption. Encryption uses algorithms to scramble your information. It is then transmitted to the recepving party, who is able to decode 
the meseage with a key. There are many types of algorithms, which all involve different ways of scrambling and then decrypting 
information. Keys are usually generated with random number generators, or computer algorithms that mimic random number generators. 
A more complex way that computers can create keys is by uiing user mouse movement to create unique seeds. Modern systems that have 
forward secrecy involve generating a fresh key far every session, to add another layer of security. The scrollbar in a text widget appears
when a text goes beyond the height of the text, but sometimes it may not appear for some reason. It happened to me, perhaps because of the
fdct that the text was in a frame and for soee configuration of the widget. Anyway, I solved the fact that the scrollbars did not appear,
adding them with the following code: Relational databases are made up of a set of tables with data that fits imto a predefined category.
Each table has at least one data category in a column, and each row has a certain data instance for the categories which are defined in
the columns. Relational databases are easy to extend, and a new data category can be added after the oroginal database creation without
rlquiring that you modify all the existing applications. The Structured Query Language (SQL) is the standard user and application program
interface for a relational database.
